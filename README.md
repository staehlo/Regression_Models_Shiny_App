# Shiny_Regression_Models_App

This is a training project that explores the functionality of R's Shiny Apps. The application lets users enter two series of data and then select either a linear or a non-linear regression model. The app will compute the equation and give out a table of goodness of fit measures. Finally, the app also displays the result in the form of an interactive plotly graph that also shows the confidence and prediction intervals.

The app can be viewed at [rahace.shinyapps.io/regression_models](https://rahace.shinyapps.io/regression_models/)
